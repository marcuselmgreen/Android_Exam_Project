## Description
When using the bank app you're able to register an user and login with cpr and password. When registering a new user, depending on the zip code you enter, the application will calculate the shortest distance from that zip code to the nearest affiliate and assign the user to this affiliate.

When logged in you're redirected to the home page where two accounts should be visible - Default and budget, along with the current balance available on the accounts.

Functionalities available include transferring money between accounts, with a nem-id confirmation when transferring to an account under another user or a pension account. This requires a key which is 123456.

The pension account will not show on the transfer activity if the user is not 77 years old.

You're able to change password along with a few other things under the settings tab.

When pressing an account from the listview at the homepage, information about the account is displayed, and if choosing an default/business account, you're able to enter an amount to transfer to the budget/savings account on a monthly basis.

Other funcionalities include viewing and creating payment services with or without autopayment, and paying your bills manually.
